Calculator-C-
=============

Fraction calculator with order of operations implemented in C++

The program is based on my Java implementation done for my AP Computer Science course. The code is written entirely in C++ and is largely a learning exercise.

### Usage
Type an expression consisting of fractions and operators and the program will evaluate it to a single fraction value.

Fractions are entered as \<whole number>_\<numerator>/\<denominator> ex:
```
1_1/2
```

### Example Output
```
Using expression evaluator V1.0 C++ by Gareth George
> 1_1/2 + 3_4/5 * 3 / 1/2
Compiler: 1_1/2, 3_4/5, 3, *, +, 1/2, / -> ((1_1/2+(3_4/5*3))/1/2)
Result: 25_4/5
```
